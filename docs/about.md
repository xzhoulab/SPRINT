iDEA integrates differential expression (DE) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) into a joint statistical framework, providing substantial power gains for both analytic tasks, and it requires gene-level summary statistics in terms of fold change/effect size estimates and their standard errors as input, which can be obtained using any existing scRNAseq DE methods.
